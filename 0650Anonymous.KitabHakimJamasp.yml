90#BOOK#COMMENT##: In catalogues, this text is mentioned as the 
   Jamaspnamah but scholars at the Austrian Academy of Sciences
   (https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ifi/forschung/manuskriptkulturen/the-book-of-jamasp-the-sage)
   have figure out that this is actually another text. 
   It belongs to the same tradition but it is a new composition 
   that they call the "Kitāb-e Ḥakīm-e Jāmasp". 
   It was written by an anonymous author in the 13th century.
